# Example input file for 'crowbar batch build' command which sets up a
# cloud with a single 2-node HA cluster using DRBD and SBD for
# STONITH, and a single KVM compute node.
#
# Assumes that the two controller nodes are aliased 'controller1' and
# 'controller2', and the compute node is aliased 'compute1'.
#
# If you are short of physical or virtual hardware and only want to
# test the controller cluster, you can skip the compute node via:
#
#   crowbar batch build -e cinder -e nova
