The [Crowbar Framework](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar) is currently maintained by [SUSE](http://www.suse.com/) as
an [OpenStack](http://openstack.org) installation framework but is prepared to be a much broader function tool. It was
originally developed by the [Dell CloudEdge Solutions Team](http://dell.com/openstack).
